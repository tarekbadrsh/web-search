According to a United Nations report, over 32 million Sudanese are now in urgent need of humanitarian assistance.\n\nThe Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) warns that 17 additional areas are at risk of famine. Nearly half of Sudan’s population—around 24.6 million people—are facing severe levels of food insecurity.\n\nThe organisation has highlighted that this reflects an unprecedented worsening and broadening of the food and nutrition crisis in Sudan, driven by the destructive conflict that has engulfed the country for nearly two years.\n\nThe war has triggered mass displacement, economic collapse, the breakdown of essential social services, significant societal unrest, and limited humanitarian access.\n\nAmid this worsening tragedy, both foreign and domestic militias have emerged as central players in the war, fighting alongside the army amid accusations of serving external agendas.\n\n**Foreign Forces and Shadow Battalions**\n\nReports indicate the presence of foreign forces backing the Sudanese army, led by Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, particularly in the states of Al-Jazira and Al-Qadarif. International reports and organisations have documented military support from Iran and Turkey.\n\nThe army is also reported to have enlisted troops affiliated with the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF), stationed in the Upper Atbara and Setit rivers region, about 30 kilometres from the city of Al-Shawwak within Al-Qadarif state.\n\nSome of these forces were recently relocated to the Harira camp, situated along the road linking Al-Qadarif to Al-Faw, which serves as a key coordination hub for joint operations with the army. Additional TPLF units are reportedly based near the Al-Maqrah camp on the outskirts of Al-Faw.\n\nThe Sudanese army has also reportedly integrated fighters from the Al-Baraa ibn Malik Battalion—an Islamist faction linked to the Muslim Brotherhood and accused by local and international organisations of committing serious abuses against civilians.\n\nAccording to a report by the Sudanese news site Al-Rakoba 13, the growing presence of these so-called “shadow battalions” highlights the Islamist movement’s firm grip on the conflict and reveals the roots of the persistent obstruction to negotiations and efforts to resolve the crisis.\n\nThe report further connects the Al-Baraa ibn Malik Battalion to the \"Popular Defence Forces,\" a paramilitary group that was active during the rule of ousted President Omar al-Bashir. Now rebranded as the “Shadow Battalions,” they have become increasingly active in supporting the Sudanese Armed Forces in its battles against the RSF.\n\n**A Vision to Preserve Sudan’s Identity**\n\nAs foreign and Islamist militias become more entrenched within the army, the Rapid Support Forces have continued their campaign, presenting themselves as defenders of the Sudanese people.\n\nThe RSF has expressed its willingness to engage in any solution that would end the war and lead to a civilian-led government chosen by the Sudanese people.\n\nWhile the army remains opposed to negotiations and continues to distract both domestic and international attention with accusations against neighbouring countries, the RSF has proposed a roadmap aimed at uniting the nation and protecting it from external domination and religious extremism.\n\nIn collaboration with civilian political forces, the RSF has introduced a foundational charter that outlines the establishment of a decentralized, secular, and democratic state in Sudan—one based on the principles of freedom, equality, and justice.\n\nThe proposed state would be free from any allegiance to ethnic, cultural, religious, or regional identity, and would recognise and represent Sudan’s diverse components on an equal footing.\n\nIt also explicitly prohibits the formation of political parties or the dissemination of political propaganda based on religion or ethnicity.\n\nThe charter unequivocally affirms the principle of voluntary unity, the sovereignty of the state over its full territory, natural resources, and territorial waters, and asserts that the Sudanese people are the original custodians of national sovereignty and the primary source of authority.\n\nAmid the deepening entanglement of militias within the army and the erosion of its institutional military identity, the charter also calls for the creation of a new national army based on professional and non-partisan military doctrine, subject to full civilian oversight.\n\nIt likewise proposes a professional police force dedicated to safeguarding Sudan’s internal and external security.\n\n**DISCLAIMER:** The

These Refugees Were Hit Instead.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Airstrikes carried out by the Sudanese military in Darfur have been sending refugees fleeing for safety and medical treatment, as they describe being victimized by bombs intended for the army’s opposition.\n\nTen-year-old Isah Abdallah Fadul was injured last year in an airstrike at a busy market in Darfur. Isah and her family are among the latest arrivals from Sudan seeking medical treatment at this Doctors Without Borders clinic amid a violent civil war. The Sudanese military and paramilitary fighters with Sudan’s Rapid Support Forces, have been engaged in a brutal conflict since April of 2023. According to a recent U.N. report, the military has been carrying out airstrikes to repel advances by the R.S.F., resulting in high death tolls and a worsening humanitarian situation that is sending refugees fleeing to remote parts of the border. A bomb from one of these airstrikes hit Isah 10 months ago, shortly after paramilitary troops infiltrated the market. Her father bandaged her injuries, but finding proper treatment had been challenging, until now. Doctors Without Borders recently scaled up their mobile clinic services to meet the growing demand of refugee arrivals. That number is expected to rise after Sudan’s military retook the capital of Khartoum in March. And as the R.S.F. regroups in its Darfur stronghold, this was the scene just days later when another airstrike hit an open-air market in Northern Darfur. The Sudanese military and the R.S.F. have both been accused of atrocities. After the market airstrike, the army was accused of indiscriminately attacking civilian areas. The army responded that any allegations that the attack was an atrocity committed against civilians are completely false. Meanwhile, the R.S.F. has faced frequent accusations by the United States of genocide over ethnic massacres carried out by its soldiers and allied militias. Again and again, a pattern emerged in our interviews with survivors. R.S.F. troops would move into a village or town, only to be followed by a Sudanese military airstrike. At this refugee camp in Adré, further south along the Sudanese border, another family that just arrived shared their story. For refugees who do make it across the border, the first step is to assess and treat before making decisions on what comes next. Back in Tiné, Isah’s doctors say her leg is infected and that she’ll have to be transferred to a larger hospital in the coming days.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLIVE\n\n00:00\n\n4:49\n\nAirstrikes in Darfur Missed Their Target.

Sudan’s civil war is entering its third year, and increasing airstrikes have been a driving factor for many refugees now fleeing the country for safety in neighboring Chad.\n\n“I’m always afraid of the planes,” said Kubrah Abdullah Dawood, 25, a Sudanese refugee who had just crossed the border alone with her 11-month-old daughter. Doctors Without Borders staff members quickly ushered her into a makeshift tented clinic just steps from the border, where she told them that she fled Darfur’s capital, El Fasher, after an airstrike killed her brother. She said it had been a drone attack by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, the R.S.F.\n\n“As the Sudanese Armed Forces have made progress in Khartoum, we’ve seen more \\[R.S.F.\\] moving towards Darfur,” said Kate Hixon, advocacy director for Sub-Saharan Africa Amnesty USA. “Wherever the R.S.F. is, we’ve seen burning of villages, blocking of aid, conflict related sexual violence, and we expect an increase in that in the coming weeks.”\n\nWhile Ms. Hixon notes an expected increase in ground attacks as the R.S.F. regroups in its Darfur stronghold, she said airstrikes from both sides of the war had been a driving factor of recent displacement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n[SKIP ADVERTISEMENT](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/06/world/africa/sudan-strikes-refugees.html#after-story-ad-1)\n\nIn recent months, the influx of refugees to the region prompted Doctors Without Borders to scale up its services along the more rural northern border regions of Chad. Survivors who recently fled the Darfur region described to The New York Times how airstrikes by Sudan’s military would follow shortly after R.S.F. fighters infiltrated their villages or marketplaces.\n\n“The R.S.F. would raid the village, \\[and then\\] the \\[Sudanese military\\] would strike,” said Fayza Adam Yagub, 38, from Saraf Omra, at a refugee camp in Adré, Chad. “But the R.S.F. would manage to escape, and the poor people were the ones getting hit.”\n\nAs recently as March 25, a Sudanese military airstrike in the small village of Toura in North Darfur [killed at least 54 people](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/25/world/africa/sudan-military-bombing-darfur.html) and wounded dozens more, according to local monitoring groups, which called the attack a war crime — an accusation the army has denied. The R.S.F. fighters, and their allied militias, have also been accused of targeting civilians.\n\nSudan’s military and the R.S.F. have been embroiled in a brutal civil war that has killed nearly 20,000 civilians and displaced over 12 million people, according to the United Nations, which noted that the situation was only getting worse.\n\n*   Share full article\n    \n\nAdvertisement\n\n[SKIP ADVERTISEMENT](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/06/world/africa/sudan-strikes-refugees.html#after-bottom)\n\nSite Index\n----------\n\nSite Information Navigation\n---------------------------\n\n*   [© 2025 The New York Times Company](https://help.nytimes.com/hc/en-us/articles/115014792127-Copyright-notice)\n\n*   [NYTCo](https://www.nytco.com/)\n*   [Contact Us](https://help.nytimes.com/hc/en-us/articles/115015385887-Contact-Us)\n*   [Accessibility](https://help.nytimes.com/hc/en-us/articles/115015727108-Accessibility)\n*   [Work with us](https://www.nytco.com/careers/)\n*   [Advertise](https://advertising.nytimes.com/)\n*   [T Brand Studio](https://www.tbrandstudio.com/)\n*   [Your Ad Choices](https://www.nytimes.com/privacy/cookie-policy#how-do-i-manage-trackers)\n*   [Privacy Policy](https://www.nytimes.com/privacy/privacy-policy)\n*   [Terms of Service](https://help.nytimes.com/hc/en-us/articles/115014893428-Terms-of-service)\n*   [Terms of Sale](https://help.nytimes.com/hc/en-us/articles/115014893968-Terms-of-sale)\n*   [Site Map](https://www.nytimes.com/sitemap/)\n*   [Canada](https://www.nytimes.com/ca/)\n*   [International](https://www.nytimes.com/international/)\n*   [Help](https://help.nytimes.com/hc/en-us)\n*   [Subscriptions](https://www.nytimes.com/subscription?campaignId=37WXW)\n\n          \n\nWe’ve updated our terms\n=======================\n\nWe encourage you to review our updated [Terms of Sale](https://help.nytimes.com/hc/en-us/articles/115014893968-Terms-of-Sale), [Terms of Service](https://help.nytimes.com/hc/en-us/articles/115014893428-Terms-of-Service), and [Privacy Policy](https://help.nytimes.com/hc/en-us/articles/10940941449492-The-New-York-Times-Company-Privacy-Policy-).

    "ai_summary": "# Foreign and Domestic Militias Fuel Sudan's War: Are There Any Safeguards Against the Nation's Hijacking?\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe war in Sudan, which began in April 2023 between the national army and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), has resulted in thousands of deaths and millions of displacements. The conflict has led to a severe humanitarian crisis, with over 32 million Sudanese in urgent need of humanitarian assistance.\n\n## Foreign Forces and Shadow Battalions\n\nReports indicate the presence of foreign forces backing the Sudanese army. International reports and organizations have documented military support from Iran and Turkey. The army has also enlisted troops affiliated with the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), stationed in the Upper Atbara and Setit rivers region.\n\nThe Sudanese army has integrated fighters from the Al-Baraa ibn Malik Battalion, an Islamist faction linked to the Muslim Brotherhood. The growing presence of these so-called \"shadow battalions\" highlights the Islamist movement's firm grip on the conflict.\n\n## A Vision to Preserve Sudan's Identity\n\nThe Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have presented themselves as defenders of the Sudanese people. The RSF has proposed a roadmap aimed at uniting the nation and protecting it from external domination and religious extremism.\n\nIn collaboration with civilian political forces, the RSF has introduced a foundational charter that outlines the establishment of a decentralized, secular, and democratic state in Sudan. The proposed state would be free from any allegiance to ethnic, cultural, religious, or regional identity.\n\n## Key Provisions of the Charter\n\n*   **Decentralized and Secular State**: The charter proposes a decentralized and secular state, ensuring equal representation for all Sudanese.\n*   **No Political Parties Based on Religion or Ethnicity**: The charter prohibits the formation of political parties or dissemination of political propaganda based on religion or ethnicity.\n*   **Voluntary Unity**: The charter affirms the principle of voluntary unity, the sovereignty of the state over its full territory, and the primary source of authority being the Sudanese people.\n\n## Safeguards Against Hijacking\n\nThe charter calls for the creation of a new national army based on a professional and non-partisan military doctrine, subject to full civilian oversight. The RSF's vision for Sudan aims to prevent the nation's hijacking by extremist groups and ensure a democratic future.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe conflict in Sudan is complex, with both domestic and foreign militias playing a significant role. The RSF's proposed charter offers a vision for a decentralized, secular, and democratic state, which could provide safeguards against the nation's hijacking. However, the implementation of this vision remains uncertain, and the international community must continue to monitor the situation closely.\n\n> The views, comments, opinions, contributions, and statements made by readers and contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\n### Related Stories\n\n*   [Salaga South MP advocates reparations to Africa](https://www.myjoyonline.com/salaga-south-mp-advocates-reparations-to-africa)\n*   [Forbes List: Africa’s current 22 richest people](https://www.myjoyonline.com/forbes-list-africas-current-22-richest-people)\n*   [Global fashion waste crisis: Africa calls for an end to ‘waste colonialism’](https://www.myjoyonline.com/global-fashion-waste-crisis-africa-calls-for-an-end-to-waste-colonialism)\n\n### Most Popular News\n\n*   [Second-year student shot by classmate at ADASS, Kumasi](https://www.myjoyonline.com/second-year-student-shot-by-classmate-at-adass-kumasi)\n*   [Four killed in gang fight at Wiamoase in A/R](https://www.myjoyonline.com/four-killed-in-gang-fight-at-wiamoase-in-a-r)\n*   [Kwakye Ofosu and Ntim Fordjour clash on social media over flight claims after Newsfile](https://www.myjoyonline.com/kwakye-ofosu-and-ntim-fordjour-clash-on-social-media-over-flight-claims-after-newsfile)"
